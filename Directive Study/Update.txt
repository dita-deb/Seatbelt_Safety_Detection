Progress update has been really slow as I've taken time away from this project to work on a facial detection feature.
I'll eventually get back to this as soon as time permits.

I'll utilize a reference file for implementing the ML model on a USB camera attached to my Jetson Nano.
Unfortunately, the Python version on my Jetson Nano is not high enough for me to use most ML Neural Network models because of the 
implementation of weights and biases. I'll have to work it out as much as possible.

I'll take the time to implement the two models into one this upcoming. I have a few models up on Jupyter Notebook that I'm still in
the process of debugging.
